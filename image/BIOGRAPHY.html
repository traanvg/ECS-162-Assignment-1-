      This webpage is a personal portfolio that shows another side of myself beside coding such as my photos about travel, 
      my favorite activities, and my two lovely orange cats.
      I choose a simple design with black and white colors to support the vibrant colors of my photos. 
      The text design is clear and simple, ensuring readability across devides and easy to understand. 
      Responsive design was achieved through CSS media queries, adjusting elements and image sizes
      based on screen width. 
      Text and images stack vertically in mobile views for better navigation and readability.
      Accessibility is ensure by semantic HTML5 tags for structure, alt attributes for all 
      images, and ensuring all interactive elements are keyboard accesible.
      This project was very meaningful to me because it gives me an opportunity to show my interest such as 
      my photography and travel through web development. I understand more about the concept of the web development. It is not 
      just coding, it is the process of how I translate my idea into a website, how I design my own website, and use this website to 
      introduce myself and communicate with the readers. 
      Some challenges I faced such as I am not sure if my design looks good or not, choosing reasonable element for images and texts, 
      consider betwween choosing fixed or relative value for property position of footer, choosing font size not too big but also not too small,
      choosing good font type for text, especially for the header because it is the first impression when reader look at my website. 
      Eventually, I have learned and improved my skills in both CSS and HTML5.

            First time in New York was on new year 2023. 
            I came there for the ball drop because it was pretty famous all around the world.
            I was overwhelmed by the number of people in the Time Square on January 1st.
            They came there to celebrate new year together. 
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="p2">
          <p>
            The time was like completely stop when they count down together and wait for the ball drop.
            I was suprised because people are so enjoyable celebrating this together although they needed to wait there for like 12 hours.
            I feel like they just wait for this moment after went over the past year.
          </p>
        </div>
       <div class="p2">
        <p>
          It was tired walking and tired standing there for a few hours honestly.
          It was also so cold. I can see the air when I breathed.
          However this experience is amazing and unforgettable to me. 
          I would try to come again in the future, maybe another season, to feel another kind of atmosphere.
